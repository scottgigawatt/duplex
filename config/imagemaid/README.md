# Image Maid Configuration

The `imagemaid` directory serves as the `/config` directory for the ImageMaid container in the Duplex repository. It contains a `.env` file to configure the ImageMaid Python program.

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains environment variables used to configure ImageMaid. Detailed information about these environment variables can be found [here](https://kometa.wiki/en/nightly/kometa/scripts/imagemaid/#example-env-file).

Feel free to adjust the values of these environment variables in the `.env` file according to your specific requirements.
