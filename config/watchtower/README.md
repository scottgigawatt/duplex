# 🚀 Watchtower Run Once Configuration

Welcome to the `watchtower` directory! This directory contains the Docker Compose configuration for running Watchtower **one time only** using the `WATCHTOWER_RUN_ONCE` environment variable. 🕒 Watchtower will check for updates on the specified containers, apply them, and then exit.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Clone Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scottgigawatt/duplex.git
   cd duplex/config/watchtower
   ```

2. **Configure Environment:**
   - 📋 Copy `example.env` to `.env` and configure the variables, including the container names you want to update.

3. **Run Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   🎯 This will trigger Watchtower to:
   - Run once
   - Check for container updates
   - Apply updates if available 🧩
   - Exit when complete.
