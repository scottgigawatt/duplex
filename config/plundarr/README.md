> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚓ Ye don't need Plundarr to sail with Duplex, but it'll make yer voyages faster, smoother, and far more legendary.

So grab yer spyglass, summon yer inner Jack Sparrow 🍹, and chart a course for **Plundarr**—where automation flows like rum at a port tavern and treasures await beyond the horizon! 🏴‍☠️ But beware, matey... once ye taste this kind o' power, ye may never go back to plain ol' manual sailin'. ⚓🦜

> [!WARNING]
> ☠️ Beware, matey! Plundarr's power comes with complexity. Tread carefully lest ye get lost in a sea of YAML and configs.

And if ye be cravin' more booty, trinkets, and magical contraptions, set yer sights on the rest of me stash here: [me other hideouts](https://github.com/scottgigawatt?tab=repositories). Yarr, no map required! 🗺️😉

> [!CAUTION]
> 🏴‍☠️⚠️ Once ye start plunderin' with Plundarr, ye might find yerself swappin' sleep fer scripting. Don't say ye weren't warned, landlubber.
