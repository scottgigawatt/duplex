## Usage 🚀

### 1. Clone the Project to Your Synology NAS 🎬

Ready to start your streaming adventure? First, clone the project repository to your Synology NAS. Use the command below to ensure you include all the necessary submodules:

> [!NOTE]
> 🎬 The Kometa configuration files are maintained in a separate repo: [kometa-config](https://github.com/scottgigawatt/kometa-config). It's included here as a submodule at `config/kometa`—hence the `--recurse-submodules` magic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cloning with submodules is crucial for proper functionality.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/scottgigawatt/duplex.git /volume1/docker/duplex
```

### 2. Managing Docker Config Environment Variables 🧩

Next, set up the configurations for the main Docker Compose deployment and ImageMaid using `.env` files. Copy the `example.env` files to `.env` and customize them for your cinematic needs.

- 📄 [View example.env](example.env)
- 📄 [View config/imagemaid/example.env](config/imagemaid/example.env)

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to edit the `.env` files to suit your individual setup.

```sh
cp example.env .env
cp config/imagemaid/example.env config/imagemaid/.env

# Edit as needed
vim .env
vim config/imagemaid/.env
```

> [!TIP]
> Want to override these variables on the fly? Just do it on the command line when starting the Docker Compose stack:
>
> ```bash
> KOMETA_TAG="nightly" docker-compose up -d
> ```

### 3. Configuring IPAM and Network Firewall 🌍

Docker IPAM (IP Address Management) lets you assign IP addresses to your containers within a defined network range. This gives you more control, avoids random IP assignments, and makes your network predictable and easier to troubleshoot.

Update these settings to your [`.env`](example.env) file:

```bash
#
# Subnet range: 172.28.0.1 - 172.28.255.254
# Total IP addresses: 65,536
# Usable IP addresses: 65,534
# Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
#
COMPOSE_NETWORK_SUBNET="${COMPOSE_NETWORK_SUBNET:-172.28.0.0/16}"

#
# IP range for containers: 172.28.5.1 - 172.28.5.254
# Total IP addresses: 256
# Usable IP addresses: 254
# Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
#
COMPOSE_NETWORK_IP_RANGE="${COMPOSE_NETWORK_IP_RANGE:-172.28.5.0/24}"

#
# Network gateway IP address: 172.28.5.254
#
COMPOSE_NETWORK_GATEWAY="${COMPOSE_NETWORK_GATEWAY:-172.28.5.254}"
```

### 4. Updating Firewall Settings on Synology NAS 🔥

If you haven't set up a firewall on your Synology NAS yet, now's a good time. A firewall helps protect your NAS and control internal and external traffic.

To allow your containers to communicate within the private Docker network, follow these steps:

To keep your containers communicating smoothly, you might need to tweak your firewall settings in Synology DSM. Follow these steps to update your **Synology Firewall** settings:

1. Open **Control Panel** → **Security** (under Connectivity).
2. Go to the **Firewall** tab → Click **Edit Rules**.
3. Click **Create** to add a rule:
   - **Ports**: Select `All`
   - **Source IP**: Select `Specific IP`
   - Click `Select` → Choose `Subnet`
   - Enter `172.28.0.0` for **IP Address** and `255.255.0.0` for **Subnet mask/Prefix length**
   - **Action**: Select `Allow`
4. Click **OK** to apply.

This ensures your containers can talk to each other smoothly inside the Docker network while your firewall still does its job of keeping unwanted traffic out.

For more info, check out the **[Docker Compose IPAM documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/06-networks/#ipam)**.

### 5. Managing the Project with DSM Container Manager 📦

Let's make your project shine in DSM 7.2 Container Manager's Project feature:

1. Log in to your Synology NAS web UI.
2. Open **Container Manager** and navigate to the **Project** tab.
3. Click **Create**, give your project a name (e.g., `duplex`), and set the project path to the cloned directory.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to review settings and deploy the project like a pro!
