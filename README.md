## Usage 🚀

### Starting the Service Stack

Ready to kick off your Duplex service stack? Follow these blockbuster steps:

1. Clone this repository to your Synology NAS, including the submodules.

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/scottgigawatt/duplex.git
   ```

   > 🎬 **Behind the Scenes**: The Kometa configuration files are maintained in a separate repo here: [kometa-config](https://github.com/scottgigawatt/kometa-config). It's included in this project as a submodule at `config/kometa`—that's why you see the `--recurse-submodules` magic in the `git clone` command. When updates roll out in the config, we bump the submodule here to sync things up, like a sequel that actually improves on the original. 🍿
   > Want to remix this setup for yourself? Fork both repos and update the URLs to point to your personal masterpieces. 🎞️✨

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Open a terminal or SSH into your Synology NAS—time to get technical!
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers in detached mode.
5. Access the services through their respective endpoints—like opening a treasure chest of media!
6. Configure services to connect to Plex using the gateway IP address of the Docker bridge network. You can find this IP in `Container Manager -> Network` for DSM 7.2 and above.
   > 🎥 **Pro Tip**: While you can use these commands for testing and debugging, we recommend running this project through DSM Container Manager for a smoother production experience. Jump to [Managing the Project with DSM Container Manager 📦](#managing-the-project-with-dsm-container-manager-) to roll out the red carpet for your deployment.

### Managing Docker Config Environment Variables 🧩

The configurations for the main Docker Compose file, ImageMaid, and Overlay Reset are managed using `.env` files. Copy the `example.env` files to `.env` and tweak them to suit your cinematic needs.

- Main Docker Compose: [example.env](example.env)
- ImageMaid: [config/imagemaid/example.env](config/imagemaid/example.env)
- Overlay Reset: [config/overlay-reset/example.env](config/overlay-reset/example.env)

Want to override these variables on the fly? Just do it on the command line when starting the Docker Compose stack:

```bash
KOMETA_TAG="latest" docker-compose up -d
```

Adjust the values of these environment variables to fit your streaming dreams.

### Managing the Project with DSM Container Manager 📦

Let's make your project shine in DSM 7.2 Container Manager's Project feature:

1. SSH into your Synology NAS and log in.
2. Clone this repository to a directory, such as `/volume1/docker/duplex` (or your preferred path).
3. Open **Container Manager** and navigate to the **Project** tab.
4. Click **Create**, give your project a name (e.g., `duplex`), and set the project path to the cloned directory.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to review settings and deploy the project like a pro!

For more on Container Manager Projects, refer to the official Synology documentation [here](https://kb.synology.com/en-id/DSM/help/ContainerManager/docker_project?version=7).

### Secure Access to Synology Applications 🔒

Want to ensure secure access to your Synology applications? Use DSM 7 Reverse Proxy! Follow the guide [here](https://mariushosting.com/synology-how-to-use-reverse-proxy-on-dsm-7/) for DSM 7.

> **Note**: If you encounter "Socket closed" errors when accessing the DSM UI via reverse proxy and trying to open terminals for running containers, enable WebSocket for the reverse proxy record:
>
> 1. Go to `Control Panel -> Application Portal -> Reverse Proxy`.
> 2. Select `Edit` for your reverse proxy record.
> 3. Navigate to the `Custom Header` tab.
> 4. From the `Create` dropdown, select `WebSocket`.
> 5. Save the changes to resolve the issue—like fixing a plot hole!
